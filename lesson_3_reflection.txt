When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
so that i can use different computers, , collaborate with others and working anywhere without any issues. also if the it gets lost or sytem crashed 
then we can have backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
it is same as wwhen to commit rahter than commit automatically, we need to have user decide when to upload  and when not 
to upload , this is to user uploaded
